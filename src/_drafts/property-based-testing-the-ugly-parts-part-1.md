# Hierarchical Timeline{background=#dddddd}

## Clips

![Clips](assets/property-based-testing-the-ugly-parts/timeline1.svg){width=80%}

<aside class="notes">
- Clips are put in video and audio tracks within parallels
- Tracks are played in parallel, hence the name
</aside>

## Video Still Frames

<aside class="notes">
If the video track is shorter, it will be padded with still frames
</aside>

## Adding Gaps

![Adding Gaps](assets/property-based-testing-the-ugly-parts/timeline3.svg){width=100%}

<aside class="notes">
- You can add explicit gaps in video and audio tracks
- These are also filled with still frames for video
</aside>

## Sequences

![Sequences](assets/property-based-testing-the-ugly-parts/timeline4.svg){width=100%}

<aside class="notes">
- Parallels are put in sequences
- Each parallel is played until its end, then the next, and so on
- Multiple parallels can be used to synchronize clips
</aside>

## Timeline

<aside class="notes">
- The top level is the timeline
- The timeline contain sequences
- It's useful for organizing the parts of your screencast

# Case Study 1: Timeline Flattening

## Timeline Flattening

* Timeline is hierarchical
  - Sequences
  - Parallels
  - Tracks
  - Clips and gaps
* FFmpeg render knows only about two flat tracks
  - Video track
  - Audio track
  
## Timeline Flattening (Graphical)

![Timeline flattening](assets/property-based-testing-the-ugly-parts/komposition-flattening.svg){width=100%}

## Testing Duration

```{.haskell emphasize=5:5-5:99}
hprop_flat_timeline_has_same_duration_as_hierarchical =
  property $ do
    t <- forAll $ Gen.timeline (Range.exponential 0 20) Gen.parallelWithClips
    let Just flat = Render.flattenTimeline t
    durationOf AdjustedDuration t === durationOf AdjustedDuration flat
````

## Testing Clip Occurence

```{.haskell emphasize=5:5-5:99,6:5-6:99}
hprop_flat_timeline_has_same_clips_as_hierarchical =
  property $ do
    t <- forAll $ Gen.timeline (Range.exponential 0 20) Gen.parallelWithClips
    let Just flat = Render.flattenTimeline t
    timelineVideoClips t === flatVideoClips flat
    timelineAudioClips t === flatAudioClips flat
```

## Further Improvements

* Missing properties
  - How are video gaps padded with still frames?
  - Same flat result regardless of grouping (split/join sequences, then flatten)
* Padding with frames from other parallels
  - Frames are only picked from video clips within the parallel
  - Should pick from _any_ video clip within the timeline
  - Write properties to guide my work
