title: "About Me"

My name is Oskar Wickström, and this website is called *Func Da World*. Here I
write about functional programming, open source software, and other delightful
things I like to share. It is my own little corner of the internet.

Growing up in the Swedish country side, I was one of those spoiled early 90's
kids who had a Pentium III processor and loads of RAM. On our home built PCs,
packed with neon lights and fans, we played Quake III, Warcraft III, and
Counter Strike, at countless LAN parties. I will, however, nod and smile
politely while you tell your tales from the Amiga and Commodore 64 days.

I still live in Sweden, in the city of Malmö. In my free time I hack on [various
programming projects](/projects.html), play the bass, and hang out with my
partner and friends. In 2016 I got a taste for public speaking and traveling,
in the form of tech conferences, and I hope to continue doing that.
