title: "About Me"

My name is Oskar Wickstr√∂m, and this is my personal website. I write
about software design, testing, functional programming, open source
software, and other delightful things I like to share.

Growing up in the Swedish country side, I was one of those spoiled early 90's
kids who had a Pentium III processor and loads of RAM. On our home built PCs,
packed with neon lights and fans, we played Quake III, Warcraft III, and
Counter Strike, at countless LAN parties. I will, however, nod and smile
politely while you tell your tales from the Amiga and Commodore 64 days.

I still live in Sweden. In my free time I hack on [various programming
projects](/projects.html), play drums, and hang out with my family,
friends, and mother nature. Every now and then I speak at conferences
and meetups.

To contact me by email, use my first name and this domain
name. Otherwise I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/owickstrom) at
times.
