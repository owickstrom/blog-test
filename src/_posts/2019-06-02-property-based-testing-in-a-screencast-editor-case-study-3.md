In the last article we looked at how Komposition automatically classifies
moving and still segments in imported video media, how I went from testing by
eye and with examples to property-based testing (PBT), and what errors I
found in the process. If you haven't read it, or its preceding posts, I
encourage you to check them out first:

This is the final case study in the "Property-Based Testing in a Screencast
Editor" series. It covers property-based integration testing and its value
during aggressive refactoring work within Komposition.

## A History of Two Stacks

In Komposition, a project's state is represented using an in-memory data
structure. It contains the hierarchical timeline, the focus, import and
render settings, project storage file paths, and more. To let users navigate
backwards and forwards in their history of project edits, for example when
they have made a mistake, Komposition supplies _undo_ and _redo_ commands.

The undo/redo history was previously implemented as a data structure
recording project states, compromised of:

* a _current state_ variable
* two stacks, holding _previous states_ and
  _possible future states_, respectively

It had the following behaviour:

* Performing an undoable/redoable action would:
  - push the previous state onto the undo stack
  - perform the action and replace the current state
  - discard all states in the redo stack
* Undoing an action would:
  - pop the undo stack and use that state as the current state
  - push the previous state onto the redo stack
* Redoing an action would:
  - pop the redo stack and use that state as the current state
  - push the previous state onto the undo stack

Note that not all user actions in Komposition are undoable/redoable. Actions
like navigating the focus or zooming are not recorded in the history.

### Dealing With Performance Problems

While the "two stacks of states" algorithm was easy to understand and
implement, it failed to meet my non-functional requirements. A screencast
project compromised of hundreds or thousands of small edits would consume
gigabytes of disk space when stored, take tens of seconds to load from disk,
and consume many gigabytes of RAM when in memory.

Now, you might think that my implementation was incredibly naive, and that
the performance problems could be fixed with careful profiling and
optimization. And you'd probably be right! I did consider going down that
route, optimizing the code, time-windowing edits to compact history on the
fly, and capping the history at some fixed size. Those would all be
interesting pursuits, but in the end I decided to try something else.

## Refactoring with Property-Based Integration Tests

Instead of optimizing the current stack-based implementation, I decided to
implement the undo/redo history in terms of _involutive_ actions. In this
model, actions not only modify the project state, they also return another
action that effectively _reverses_ the effects of the original action.
Instead of recording a new project state data structure for each edit, the
history only records descriptions of the actions themselves.

I realized early that introducing the new undo/redo history implementation in
Komposition was not going to be a small task. It would touch the majority of
command implementation code, large parts of the main application logic, and
the project binary serialization format. What it wouldn't affect, though, was
the module describing user commands in abstract.

To provide a safety net for the refactoring, I decided to cover the undo/redo
functionality with tests. As the user commands would stay the same throughout
my modifications, I chose to test at that level, which can be characterized
as integration-level testing. The tests run Komposition, including its
top-level application control flow, but with the user interface and some
other effects stubbed out. Making your application testable at this level is
hard work, but the payoff can be huge.

With Komposition featuring close to twenty types of user commands, combined
with a complex hierarchical timeline and navigation behaviour, the
combinatory explosion of possible states was daunting. Relying on
example-based tests to safeguard my work was not satisfactory. While PBT
couldn't cover the entire state space either, I was confident they would
improve my chances of finding actual bugs.

## Undo/Redo Tests

Before I began refactoring, I added tests for the involutive property of
undoable/redoable actions. The first test focuses on undoing actions, and is
structured as follows:

1. Generate an initial project and application state
1. Generate a sequence of undoable/redoable commands (wrapped in _events_)
1. Run the application with the initial state and the generated events
1. Run an undo command for each original command
1. Assert that final timeline is equal to the initial timeline

Let's look at the Haskell Hedgehog property test:

```{.haskell}
hprop_undo_actions_are_undoable = property $ do

  -- 1. Generate initial timeline and focus
  timelineAndFocus <- forAllWith showTimelineAndFocus $
    Gen.timelineWithFocus (Range.linear 0 10) Gen.parallel

  -- ... and initial application state
  initialState <- forAll (initializeState timelineAndFocus)

  -- 2. Generate a sequence of undoable/redoable commands
  events <- forAll $
    Gen.list (Range.exponential 1 100) genUndoableTimelineEvent

  -- 3. Run 'events' on the original state
  beforeUndos <- runTimelineStubbedWithExit events initialState

  -- 4. Run as many undo commands as undoable commands
  afterUndos <- runTimelineStubbedWithExit (undoEvent <$ events) beforeUndos

  -- 5. That should result in a timeline equal to the one we started
  -- with
  timelineToTree (initialState ^. currentTimeline)
    === timelineToTree (afterUndos ^. currentTimeline)
```

The second test, focusing on redoing actions, is structured very similarly to
the previous test:

1. Generate an initial project and application state
1. Generate a sequence of undoable commands (wrapped in _events_)
1. Run the application with the initial state and the generated events
1. Run an undo commands for each original command
1. Run an redo commands for each original command
1. Assert that final timeline is equal to the timeline before undoing actions

The test code is also very similar:

```{.haskell}
hprop_undo_actions_are_redoable = property $ do

  -- 1. Generate the initial timeline and focus
  timelineAndFocus <- forAllWith showTimelineAndFocus $
    Gen.timelineWithFocus (Range.linear 0 10) Gen.parallel

  -- ... and the initial application state
  initialState <- forAll (initializeState timelineAndFocus)

  -- 2. Generate a sequence of undoable/redoable commands
  events <- forAll $
    Gen.list (Range.exponential 1 100) genUndoableTimelineEvent

  -- 3. Run 'events' on the original state
  beforeUndos <- runTimelineStubbedWithExit events initialState

  -- 4. Run undo commands corresponding to all original commands
  afterRedos  <-
    runTimelineStubbedWithExit (undoEvent <$ events) beforeUndos
    -- 5. Run redo commands corresponding to all original commands
    >>= runTimelineStubbedWithExit (redoEvent <$ events)

  -- 6. That should result in a timeline equal to the one we had
  -- before undoing actions
  timelineToTree (beforeUndos ^. currentTimeline)
    === timelineToTree (afterRedos ^. currentTimeline)
```

Note that these tests only assert on the equality of timelines, not entire
project states, as undoable commands only operate on the timeline.

### Tests Pass, Everything Works

The undo/redo tests were written and run on the original stack-based
implementation, kept around during a refactoring that took me two weeks of
hacking during late nights and weekends, and finally run and passing with the
new implementation based on involutive actions. Except for a few _minimal_
adjustments to data types, these tests stayed untouched during the entire
process.

The confidence I had when refactoring felt like a super power. Two simple
property tests made the undertaking possible. They found numerous bugs,
including:

* Off-by-one index errors in actions modifying the timeline
* Inconsistent timeline focus:
  - focus was incorrectly restored on undoing an action
  - focus ended up out of bounds
* Non-involutive actions:
  - actions returning incorrectly constructed involutions
  - the involution of splitting a sequence is joining sequences, and
    joining them back up didn't always work 

After all tests passed, I ran the application with its GUI, edited a
screencast project, and it all worked flawlessly. It's almost too good to be
true, right?

Property testing is not a silver bullet, and there might still be bugs
lurking in my undo/redo history implementation. The tests I run are never
going to be exhaustive and my generators might be flawed. That being said,
they gave me a confidence in refactoring that I've never had before. As a
challenge, I encourage you to try out Komposition, perhaps even to write some
additional tests, and prove me wrong. Maybe I just haven't hit that
disastrous bug yet?

## Why Test With Properties?

This was the last case study in the "Property-Based Testing in a Screencast
Editor" series. I've had a great time writing these articles and giving talks
on the subject. Before I wrap up, I'll summarize my thoughts on PBT in
general and my experience with it in Komposition.

Property-based testing is not only for pure functions; you can use it to test
effectful actions. It is not only for unit testing; you can write integration
tests using properties. It's not only for functional programming languages; there
are many good frameworks for object-oriented languages.

Properties describe the general behaviour of the system under test, and
verify its correctness using a variety of inputs. Not only is this an
effective way of finding errors, it's also a concise way of documenting the
system.

The iterative process in property-based testing, in my experience, comes down
to the following steps:

1. Think about the specification of your system under test
1. Think about how generators and tests should work
1. Write or modify generators, tests, and implementation code, based on steps 1 and 2
1. Get minimal examples of failing tests
1. Repeat

Using PBT within Komposition has made it possible to confidently refactor
large parts of the application. It has found errors in my thinking, my
generators, my tests, and in my implementation code. Testing video scene
classification went from a time consuming, repetitive, and manual
verification process to a fast, effective, and automated task.

In short, it's been a joy, and I look forward to continue using PBT in my
work and in my own projects. I hope I've convinced you of its value, and
inspired you to try it out, no matter what kind of project you're working on
and what programming language you are using. Involve your colleagues,
practice writing property tests together, and enjoy finding complicated bugs
before your users do!
