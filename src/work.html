<p>
Through my company <em>Monoid Consulting AB</em>, I provide software
development services as a contractor. I'm based on southern Sweden,
but also work remotely.
</p>

<p>
My strengths and interests are system design, testable and
maintainable architectures, user interfaces, property-based and
model-based testing techniques, functional programming, and technical
documentation and writing. I have a wide range of experience, ranging
from back-ends and distributed systems, web programming, user
interface design, cloud deployment, and mobile applications.
