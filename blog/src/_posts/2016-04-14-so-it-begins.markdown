Yep. I'm starting a programming blog.

Potential blog post ideas cross my mind on a regular basis and until now I
haven't had any good place to post them. I want to keep [the Oden
blog](http://oden-lang.org/blog/) focused on just that project &mdash; writing
about Vim or other programming languages there would just be confusing.

A goal is to find a steady pace in publishing, even if not very frequent. The
topics might vary over time but I can assure you there will be a primary focus
on functional programming, followed by personal reflections on open source work
and the Oden Programming Language project. There's more to that project than
just coding, to put it mildly.

I hope you will enjoy the blog and keep reading!
