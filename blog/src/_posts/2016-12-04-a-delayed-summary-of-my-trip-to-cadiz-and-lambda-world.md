Earlier this year, in the beginning of October, I spoke at [Lambda World
2016](http://www.lambda.world/). The conference took place in the lovely town
of Cádiz, in southern Spain. Although two months late with this post, I wanted
to share some of my experiences and photos.

This is my first post sharing photos, and as you might notice, I like to take
a fuzzy, dark, strange, and abstract photos. The ones in this post are not that
strange, though. It feels somewhat uncomfortable showing this stuff, and to *not
only* write about programming, but I have decided to give it a sincere try.

After a stop at the Madrid airport, consuming some much needed Paella and a
glass of Rioja, a small aircraft took me to Cádiz. I was very well taken care
of by the friendly organizers of Lambda World, and arrived at the hotel, where a
pleasant surprise awaited me.

I spent the first to days in the city just walking around. I love doing that.
Jorge, one of the organizers, recommended the tapas bar *La Candela*. And so I
went, naively thinking I could get a table when showing up. It was crammed,
fully booked for days, but I managed to get a seat in the bar. The food was
fantastic, and the wine was even better.

Eventually it was time for the conference, and I had a blast! Again, the crew
at 47 Degrees did a great job organizing, and the talks I attended were very
good. It was quite a narrow FP conference, but hey, that does not hurt. Edwin
Brady gave a talk on [Type-driven Development of Communicating
Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQO9N0Y8tcM), Raichoo went [in-depth
with lazyness in GHC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu6lRZPzjGI), and the
closing keynote by Philip Wadler on [Category Theory for the Working
Hacker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V10hzjgoklA) left most jaws fully
dropped.

I met a lot of interesting people, both speakers and atteendees, all of whom I
hope to come across again. To summarize, Lambda World was a great functional
programming conference, I hope to be able attend again, and I can recommend it
to anyone interested in functional programming, be it in Scala, Haskell,
Javascript, or something else.
