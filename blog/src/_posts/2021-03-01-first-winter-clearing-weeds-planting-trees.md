In October 2020, we got our new house. Built 2013, it's not only new
to us, and this is a major upside. While I definitely can appreciate
many aspects of old houses, the comfort of a modern house fits us
first-time parents very well.

![I carelessly took snapped this picture while driving up to the house
for the first time after we got the
keys.](/assets/clearing-weeds-planting-trees/house.jpg)

The site is pretty large for a regular house, at about 10 500
m². Eight years ago when the house was built, all the existing old
trees were cut down. The weeds took over, as they often seem to do
after deforestation if nothing else is planted. The two dominant
species were blackberries (I'm not sure which kind) and "Cytisus
scoparius." Birch trees also managed to cover some ground.

It didn't take long before we made other plans for this
place. Specifically, I decided to try restoring the forest, in a way
that makes sense in this area. That means a majority of oak and beech,
some sections of birch, and a sprinkle of cherry, pine, and spruce.

Of course, I'll be long gone before the grand result of this
project. Future generations can hopefully bask in the glory of its
success. In the meantime, I'll enjoy watching these trees grow up.

Please note that I'm a clumsy hobbyist. I do get solid advice from
my sister who is a trained gardener, and from various other sources,
but you shouldn't trust anything I say or do.

## Autumn Colors, All Around

When we arrived, nature was showing its autumn palette of yellow, red,
and brown. The following photos are from walks in the area surrounding
our house.

forest creating a dramatic contrast, is one of my favorite spots

## Time To Work

Alright, enough about the surrounding nature. Around mid November I
started executing on our plan. At first, I had no power tools or
protective gear. I think that lasted about a day, after which I came
in covered in scars.

The blackberries were *everywhere*. I mean it. They often grew up to a
height of two meters by growing inside and across the Cytisus
scoparius branches, creating what I can only describe as a jungle of
barbed wire.

These two have become my mortal enemies, the main targets of this
operation. Blackberries is weed that is notoriusly hard to get rid of,
and Cytisus scoparius is classified as invasive in some countries,
though not in Sweden.

I cleared out a very small portion, including some very promising
oaklings. While scarred, my motivation was now on top. I ordered a
clearing saw and a full set of protective gear.

While waiting for the delivery, I collected acorns down by the road
and planted them in old planting boxes. Finally, I covered them in
thick layer of oak leaves, which sadly didn't stop birds from the
enjoying the smörgåsbord. We'll soon see how many of the 200-300
acorns that make it. My hopes are low on this one.

When the saw arrived, I did a first pass on the area closest to the
house. It took a while until I found a good technique and which blade
to use.

I soon realized that a more efficient workflow would be to do it in
two separate phases:

1. Get rid of as much blackberry as possible
2. Cut down all Cytisus scoparius and other excess trees

And so it went.

Finally, the north side of the road was cleared. There remains a bunch
of birch trees to be cut, but that can wait a bit.

![North side fully cleared, here in a surprisingly colorful winter
sunset.](/assets/clearing-weeds-planting-trees/cleared-side.jpg)

At this point, I had some space to work with. There's a road
construction planned at the corner of our lot, right through a little
pond of self-seeded oaklings. Instead of them getting covered by
gravel, I decided to move them to the newly cleared grounds. The
first batch was around 25-30 trees, I think.

## The Other Side

Awkwardly, the south side of the road remained uncleared. There, the
Cytisus scoparius grew even taller and more dense.

![A first round cleared some of the area behind the multi-sport court.](/assets/clearing-weeds-planting-trees/clearing-other-side.jpg)

Speaking of the multi-sport court -- it's perhaps not the most
attractive part of this place, in my opinion. But I'm guessing our
toddler might have different opinions on this matter, and so it could
come in handy.

An audiobook and some sweat later, the south side was cleared.

We got help from relatives to pile up the remaining branches. There's
a little bit left to do but the main chunk of work is done.

## Planting Oak and Beech

In a handful spots there grew small oak and beech plants that needed
moving. Either they grew too densely, below larger trees where they'd
only get shade, or in areas that needed to be kept clear (sides of the
road, for example.) I started moving them into newly cleared areas to
get a nicer spread of trees across the entire area.

I've replanted these trees with marker sticks. This makes it easy to
spot them. Also, I can support the plants by tying them to the stick,
and use them to fix the net cages.

## Pruning

Even with the fierce competition going on after the deforestation, a
bunch of oak trees managed to break through. There are some growing
4-5 m tall, already. Unfortunately they've grown very close to other
plants and got intertwined, so I've spent some time pruning.

<figcaption>
Even messier, this bunch counted almost ten separate trees. I picked out 
one and cut down the others. It's shaped strangely, but it might find its 
way.

Pruning trees like these is usually done between July and September,
but I wanted to give these a full season of unhindered
growth. Hopefully I won't regret that decision.

## Springtime!

Last week, spring was declared in southern Sweden. Finally! I spent
the weekend caging in small trees to (hopefully) protect them from
wildlife, and to give them a more focused upwards growth.  I've used
cable ties to straighten and support the smaller trees, but I'm not
sure if that's a bad idea. Maybe I need to swap them for some softer
rope.

Some of the larger trees had grown a bit sideways due to competition,
so I bought heavy piles and used them for support.

And that's where I am now, eagearly awaiting the warmth of spring and
summer, and the blossoming of trees and flowers. We really don't know
what might show up!

If you've read this far, I hope you have enjoyed the first part of our
journey. If so, let me know, and I might post more pictures and words
on this subject. You can also follow me on Twitter, where I nowadays
torture my followers with both tech and gardening tweets.
